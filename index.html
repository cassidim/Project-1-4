<br>Hi, my name is Cassidi Mitchell. I work full time at a private school and part time at a tiki bar. I am currently enrolled in 3 classes, working on getting my A.S. and certificate in app developement. I am a single mother to a 10 year old daughter. We have a Great Dane named Hagrid, I am clearly a huge Harry Potter fan. Family and God mean everything to me, without both in my life, I would not be where I am today.
